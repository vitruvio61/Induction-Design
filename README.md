# Induction-Design
Architecture as a game of languages
Archabout research proposal on generative software

Abstract

Nowadays the software market offers, in addition to traditional CAD 2D/3D, softwares able to manage the stream of work in its complexity, from its first idea until detailed documentation, computing and realistic presentations.
Most advanced tools (BIM) are built upon parametric objects or technological elements’ database, that are assembled and settled among software environments.
Our attention is focused instead on compositive side of architectural design.
Our goal in fact is to develop a generative software based upon determinated logic keys that constitute the structure of an architectural language. Thus, the objects within the software should not be just technological elements (brick walls, pillars, concrete floors etc.), but conceptual elements, signs, all characterized by their specific behaving characteristics, in two ways: through their specific inner nature (semantic connotation) and through their relationships that bond together architecture with the context (syntax).
Contemporary architectural culture, after Modern Architecture’s crisis (thanks to, has searched inspiration in the architecture of the past (post-modernism), in the muscles of technology (hi-tech) and following evolutive process of nature.
In order to exceed the logic of nature/history imitation, our attempt is to extract the DNA of the architecture from the analytical study of the logics that respond to the architectonic production of the past and of the present time; the sense of this operation is to be able to extract elementary constituent principles and to develop possible models that could generate new organisms, as logical structures adaptation to the context. Context is meant like physical environment, natural or human lived, and also like social-economic grid.
The generative software which we think would have to be based on logical-parametric and functional elements (than in our search we call “septum”, “wall”, “element”, etc) that only in a later phase they would acquire the technological attributes related to their constructive role (walls, pillars, floors, etc).

Our plan would be based, instead, on the syntactic relationships (see as an example, in the architecture of classic and renaissance age, the system of the architectonic orders) between the elements of the language; such elements initially would be related to the principles of Architecture for Elements, developed from the study of ancient Rome, within my researches with Prof. Gianfranco Moneta (University of Rome La Sapienza – Faculty of Architecture).
But this experience would also develop other language games, always syntactically coherent, all of them able to generate, varying the data input, other possible design solutions, on which the designer can then choose between the possible alternatives, as an ulterior elaboration and custom shaping, also in the technological-constructive specification.
In other words, the product would be a sort of “Lego(TM) box” in which the bricks are not walls and windows, but meta-objects with an architectonic behaviour that can be side-placed and can interact only through logic rules established in the language game. The software could be developed in two versions:

1.	A base version would allow to students of architecture to plan coherent organisms, not based upon the imitation of archistars’ projects, but always equipped of a meaningful and right articulation of the constituent elements;
2.	A professional version, with a module of development purposely studied, eventually with an its own programming language, would supply the professionals with an instrument that could generate their own design project through a meta-design phase, based on language games that rule the entire organism and that can relate itself to pre-existing context.
Such software could constitute a compositive instrument in order to produce complex organisms, to propose not arbitrary architectonic solutions in professional field, to develop programs of architectonic research within University and Academic fields (from landscape planning to architectonic planning, from scenography design, to interior design).

1.	Aims/Goal
Our goal is to create softwares that could increase the "Analysis-project interaction" compositive method, following and developing the basic structure of Watanabe’s Induction Cities, so to build up a design tool based upon a two-directional process, that goes from the analysis of a specific urban and territorial site, to its design project and vice-versa.

Induction Cities' basic methodological structure, could be integrated and extended through a series of specific contributions coming from historical-morphological process-based  analysis created and developed until 2005, by prof. Gianfranco Moneta at the University of Rome "La Sapienza" (interaction Analysis-project) and brought forward to this days by me.

Theoretical foundations of this proposal are:

Form-shaping process, common to the nature and human life, it's a process-based continous movement and it's built as a sequence of happenings that have a link between all of them; this sequence collects old shapes and creates always new ones. 
There are shapes because there's a continuos transforming activity; The history of civilization is the history of social shapes that are renewed, the history of aesthetic shapes that are transformed into new aesthetic shapes, the history of old words that are transformed into new words.
The "shape" is therefore "formation", and therefore as metamorphosis without shape does not exist, then shape without metamorphosis does not exist too; metamorphosis is also intended as a structural and functional "modification".
The "shape-metamorphosis-new shape" succession, is not however a kind of linear succession, but it proceeds through jumps, fractures, interruptions like any "historical" process, of which it represents a particular Body. 
It follows that the relationship with the past is ineluctable and it is expressed by the ways of the "re-memoryzation" but also of the "going beyond"; the first one could never be mere capture; the second one contains and is bearer of the needs and the knowledge of contemporaneity.
The relationship with the past is thus intended and re-proposed as a comparison between linguistic structure "present and living" in different ages, and through this comparison the "inner-ize-ing" of historical memory, becomes an aware action of modern sensibility, a recurrent act during the history of the architecture from the Adrian age till now.

2.	item/subject
We would expand theoretical diagram called, in “Architecture by Elements” method, “Pattern Abstraction”, to become a digital model.
See "Astrazione Tipica" (Pattern Abstraction) examples on attached files
3.	method/tool
This software could be developed through two operative steps:
	Step 1
A) developing of a 3d modeler that could handle parametric objects; they wouldn't be technological objects (i.e. a wall, a window, etc.), but linguistic elements of architecture (see Architecture by Elements: “Element", “Wall”, "Septum") and their connections.
B) developing a parametric GIS (through the analysis of useing and re-useing territory, intended as historical territory).
Step 2
Developing of a generative software handling data systems taken from both architectural and territorial analysis; analysis could be processed by a digital engine (software core) simulating both growth and trasformation process of a town, or a building generation from given specifications (connections among linguistic elements taken from analysis, see also: “Organizing Patterns” on attached files
See also a developing of Analysis-project Interaction example through G. Moneta's traditional methodology (an intuitive analogic path)
4.	present step
Searching for international funds for the research.
5.	value
The original contribution of our research proposal, is to insert it into Watanabe's generative mechanism bringing inside it a series of data taken from processes based upon historical transformations, involved with the operative sites choosen for the research. This can be achieved through an historical-morphological analysis method, fine-tuned during 30 years of practice.
Following the Watanabe   structure of Induction Cities, it is possible to re-build the entire process of historical transformation of a specific urban-territorial site, so to adjust the useing/re-useing previsions and transformation of the same site, through a principle of induction of historical phenomenons, and thus avoiding, as an innovative and peculiar contribution, every mimetic, analogical, a-contextual behaviour within the urban hereabout.

6.	practice
